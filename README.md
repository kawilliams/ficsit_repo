# ficsit_repo
This is a test repository for the FICSIT members

Make a text file (.txt) with your name and major as the contents and name the text file your username + .txt (so for me, kawilliams.txt). Click "Upload files" on the right of the screen and add your file. 

Now, find someone else's file and edit it (click on the file name and then the little pencil that says "Edit" when you hover over it). Add the text "I found your file! - *your name*". Scroll to the bottom, select "Create a new branch" and title the branch with your first name. This will submit a pull request to the original owner of the file and they will (hopefully) approve it.
